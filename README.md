Improves your development with portlets that are created with `yo liferay-js` ðŸ¥³ðŸŽ‰

Tool, which downloads a liferay page from a liferay portal and configures a webpack with the fetched index.html. Which
automatically loads your index.js from your js-portlet into webpack.

# Advantages of lfr-js-start to the lnbs-start:

- You are in the context of a liferay page
- You have all the window.Liferay.* functions
- You get the correct Language keys
- You have the original config of the portlet
- Vue and Typescript files work

# How to Use

## How to install

```
npm install --save-dev @clavis/lfr-js-portlet-utils
```

### Add a script call to the package.json

```
  "scripts": {
    "start": "lfr-js-start"
  }
```

### Place and Configure Portlet

Deploy your portlet on the Liferay instance and place it on the root, so you see it when you call 'localhost:8080' for
example. Be sure the page is public. Authorization is not supported so far.

### Run

```
npm run start
```

## Example usage

# Config

You can configure the npm task with a 'liferay.portlet.config.js' in the root of the module. Here is the default config,
which will be taken when no custom config is found:

```
module.exports = {
  protocol: 'http',
  host: 'localhost',
  originPort: 8080,
  port: 3000,
  remove: {
    selector: '[id^=js-portlet-] + script'
  },
  initCall: {
    selector: '[id^=js-portlet-] + script',
    id: 'portletElementId'
  },
  sources: {
    js: '/src/index.js'
  },
  user: 'test@liferay.com',
  password: 'test'
}

```

But there is also the possibility to only configure the wrong values and your and the default config get merged

## protocol

Used to find the protocol which your Portal runs

## host

Used to find the host on which your Portal runs

## originPort

Used to find the port on which your Portal runs

## port

Specifies on which port webpack runs

## remove

Remove groups all configs of which parts of the fetched index.html needs to be removed

#### selector

Specifies a typical selector like in 'jQuery' to find all the things that need to be removed on the fetched index.html

## initCall

The initcall attribute groups all configs of the extraction of the configs from the portal. Through this init config we
can extract the configuration in the portal and use it in our webpack

#### selector

Specifies a typical selector like in 'jQuery' to find the part in which the init call is fired for the js-portlet

#### portletElementId

Specifies which attribute of the parsed config is the id.

## sources

The sources attribute groups all the attributes which depend on the sources

#### js

This is the main js file. The entrypoint for webpack.

## user

Specifies the username/email with that you can log in. Currently, used to set a variable called "LIFERAY_USER" \
Default is "test@liferay.com" \
Careful this variable isn't available in the deployment on the liferay!

## password

Specifies the password for the user you want to log in. Currently, used to set a variable called "LIFERAY_PASSWORD"\
Default value is "test" \
Careful this variable isn't available in the deployment on the liferay!

# Common problems

## Enable CORS

If you have some problems with CORS maybe you need to configure Liferay to allow some requests from a different
endpoint:. More infos in the Liferay documentation:
https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360030377272-Configuring-CORS

## XSRF-Token

Liferay protects itself with a XSRF-Token. Also known as authToken. Obviously you can't get that token on another site,
because that's the idea of an XSRF-Token. To prevent this you can either work with Basic-auth (because it's only local).
If you use BasicAuth you can use the password and login which you can configure in the `liferay.portlet.config.js`.

I think you could also register an OAuth 2 Application in Liferay, but I never tried that so far.

You can also deactivate the whole checking of the authToken, but that is a little too much:

```
auth.token.check.enabled=false
```
